This is a Task Management API to familiarise myself with FastAPI and PostgreSQL.

### Concepts covered:

- Organisation of files into modules
- Use of \_\_init\_\_ files to manage imports and set up a Python package structure
##### Database

- SQLAlchemy for database operations
##### FastAPI Concepts
- Endpoints with decorators (post, get, get uncompleted)
- Response models
- Dependency injection for database sessions
